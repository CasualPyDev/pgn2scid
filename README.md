# pgn2scid
A convenient  GUI wrapper for scmerge and pgnscid with some extra functionality

What is pgn2scid?

pgn2scid basically is a convenient GUI wrapper (a graphical user interface for command line tools) for 'pgnscid' and 'scmerge', two programs to convert PGN files to native 'Scid' database files and to merge a number of 'Scid' files with an existing 'Scid' database. Both tools should be part of a standard 'Scid vs. PC' installation.

But there's more! In detail pgn2scid can:

* run on multiple platforms

* keep your database up to date automatically by downloading the PGN game collections kindly provided by 'The Week in Chesss' (http://theweekinchess.com/).

* keep track of your downloads so that only the latest files which haven’t already been downloaded are displayed.

* process PGN files from other sources, let’s say from your last OTB tournament or games played on a chess server. All you have to do is to put those files in pgn2scid’s working directory.

* automatically uncompress zipped PGN files.

* automatically merge a number of PGN files into one single file.

* convert any number of PGN files to the native 'Scid' database format without the hassle of using command line tools.

* create a zipped backup of an existing 'Scid' database before performing any database merge operations.

* add any number of 'Scid' files to an existing database also without to use a command line tool.

* every step described above is optional.

* store all settings in an initialisation file so pgn2scid is already preconfigured next time it is started.
